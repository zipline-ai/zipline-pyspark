"""
The log flattener job requires a schema table to query.
The schema table provides the latest schema based on the schema hash (stored in keyBytes)

This implementation assumes a pubsub bigQuery subscription to create the loggable_response table.
The fields are stored as bytes and such the schema can be decoded by casting to string.
